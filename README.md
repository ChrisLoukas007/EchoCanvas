# 🎭 AI Monologue Generator

Welcome to the **AI Monologue Generator**, a research-driven project that explores the intersection of visual art, emotion, and language generation using advanced machine learning techniques. 

This project takes a painting and a set of metadata (title, artist, style, emotion, etc.) as input, and generates a **first-person monologue** that imagines what the subject of the painting might say — as if coming to life.

## 🧠 Project Goal

To build a custom multi-modal AI model that learns to generate expressive, emotionally rich monologues conditioned on both image (painting) and text (metadata). Unlike traditional captioning models, this model aims for **artistic storytelling and emotional depth**.

## 🧩 How It Works

> **Input:** An image of a painting + metadata  
> **Output:** A generated first-person monologue expressing the painting’s emotion and imagined thoughts

The model pipeline includes:
- **Vision Encoder** to extract features from the painting
- **Text Encoder** to process metadata like title, artist, emotion
- **Fusion Mechanism** to combine visual + textual features
- **Text Decoder** to generate the monologue

## Each entry in the dataset includes:

- 🖼️ Image path
- 🖊️ Title, artist, year
- 🎨 Artistic style
- 😢 Emotional tone
- 👤 Subject (e.g., woman, soldier, angel)
- 🗣️ Ground truth monologue (manually curated or semi-automated)
