🎨 ArtScribe - First-Person Monologue Generator

Welcome to ArtScribe, a research-centric project exploring the fusion of visual art, emotional expression, and natural language generation through custom machine learning architectures.

This project takes a painting alongside its metadata — such as title, artist, style, emotion, and subject — and generates a first-person monologue, imagining the voice and inner world of the painting’s subject.

🧠 Project Goal

To design and train a multi-modal AI system capable of generating emotionally resonant monologues conditioned on both visual content and contextual metadata. This project goes beyond simple captioning, aiming instead for narrative depth and emotional storytelling.

🧩 How It Works

Input: Painting image + metadata
Output: A generated monologue in first-person perspective, reflecting the subject’s inner voice
The system architecture includes:

🎥 Vision Encoder to extract visual semantics from the painting
📝 Text Encoder for metadata like title, artist, year, and emotion
🔄 Fusion Module to combine vision and text representations
✍️ Text Decoder to craft the monologue in expressive natural language
🧪 Dataset

Each entry in the dataset includes:

🖼️ Image path
🖊️ Title, artist, year
🎨 Artistic style
😢 Emotional tone
👤 Subject (e.g., woman, soldier, angel)
🗣️ Ground truth monologue (manually curated or semi-automated)
🤝 Contributing

This is an independent, experimental research initiative. If you're passionate about AI storytelling, creative generation, or wish to contribute ideas, datasets, or models — let’s connect!
